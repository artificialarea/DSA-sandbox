/*

PRACTICE TASK 02:
Given a sorted linked list, write an algorithm to delete all duplicate numbers from the sorted linked list.

///////////////////////////////////

Question: Presumably for this exercise I'm just treating an array as a linked list and not using indexing? Or do I need to create a LinkedList class first and then create a helper to remove dupliates?
